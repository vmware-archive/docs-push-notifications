title: iOS Push Client SDK
---

#Version#

This document covers the Pivotal Cloud Foundry Push Notification Service iOS Push Client SDK v1.3.0.

Old documentation:

* [Version 1.0.4](../1.0.4/index.html)

#Features#

The [Pivotal Cloud Foundry Mobile Services](https://network.pivotal.io/products/pcf-mobile-services) Push Client SDK is
a light-weight library that will help your application register with the [PCF Mobile Services Push
Notifications](https://network.pivotal.io/products/push-notification-service) server.

The SDK does not provide any code for registering with APNS or for handling remote push notifications.

#Device Requirements#

The Push SDK requires iOS 7.0 or greater.

#Getting Started#

In order to receive push messages from the Push Server in your iOS application, you will need to follow these steps:

## Step 1 - Configure iOS Push Notifications on Apple Developer ##

Follow the steps in the document [iOS Developer Library - Configuring Push Notifications]
(https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/IDEs/Conceptual/AppDistributionGuide/ConfiguringPushNotifications/ConfiguringPushNotifications.html#//apple_ref/doc/uid/TP40012582-CH32-SW1)
in order to create an **Explicit App Id with Push Notifications enabled**.

* Note that you can NOT use a Wildcard App ID in an application with push notifications.

## Step 2 - Configure iOS Push Notifications on the Push Dashboard ##

Create your application and platforms on the PCF Mobile Services Push Dashboard. You will need two platforms -- one
for **development** mode and one for **production**. Each of these two platforms will need their own Apple Push
Notification Service (APNS) SSL certificates; the development platform needs a **sandbox** SSL certificate and the
production platform needs a **production** SSL certificate. You will need to export both of these certificates and
their associated private signing keys as **P12 files** using the **Keychain Access** program on our Mac OS machine.
This task is beyond the scope of this document (please see the documentation for the Push Notification Service
Dashboard).  After setting up your platforms in the administration console make sure to note the **Platform UUID**
and **Platform Secret** parameters have been defined under Configuration for both platforms. You will need them below.

You can find steps on how to create your application and platforms on PCF Mobile Services Push Dashboard notes:
[Push Dashboard Document](http://docs.pivotal.io/mobile/push/dashboard-user-guide_v1-2.html)

## Step 3 - Link to the Framework ##

1. Download the project framework from Pivotal Network and add it to your project in Xcode. You can drag and drop the
   .framework file into your project in the Project Navigator view. Make sure to enable **Copy items if needed**.

1. Go to the Build Settings in Xcode.  Go to the General tab.  Remove PCFPush.framework from the **Linked Frameworks And
   Libraries**. Add PCFPush.framework to the list of **Embedded Binaries**.

1. Go to Build Settings in Xcode, then navigate down to the **Linking** section and add **-ObjC** to **Other Linker Flags**.

## Step 4 - Set up your Pivotal.plist file ##

Create a **Pivotal.plist** file in your project's root directory. The following keys are required:

Key                                      | Type    | Required? | Description
---                                      | ---     | ---       | ---
pivotal.push.serviceUrl                  | String  | YES       | The URL of the PCF Push Notification Service API Server.
pivotal.push.platformUuidDevelopment     | String  | YES       | The platform UUID of your push development platform.
pivotal.push.platformSecretDevelopment   | String  | YES       | The platform secret of your push development platform.
pivotal.push.platformUuidProduction      | String  | YES       | The platform UUID of your push production platform.
pivotal.push.platformSecretProduction    | String  | YES       | The platform secret of your push production platform.
pivotal.push.geofencesEnabled            | Boolean | NO        | Set to 'YES' in order to use geofences (described below).
pivotal.push.trustAllSslCertificates     | Boolean | NO        | Set to 'YES' in order to ignore SSL certificate
                                                               | validation (not safe in production!).

* None of the above values may be `nil`.  None of the above values may be empty.

* The `pivotal.push.platformUuidDevelopment` and `pivotal.push.platformSecretDevelopment` parameters should be
the **development platform UUID** and **secret** values from the Push Dashboard. The Push Client SDK uses this platform
if it detects that the APNS Sandbox environment is being used at runtime.  These values may not be empty or `nil`.

* The `pivotal.push.platformUuidProduction` and `pivotal.push.platformSecretProduction` parameters should be
the **production platform UUID** and **secret** values from the Push Dashboard.  Note that if you are just trying the
Push Client SDK out and don't have an actual production environment set up then you can put dummy data in these fields.
These values may not be empty or `nil`.

## Step 5 - Register for Push Notifications with APNS ##

You will need to register your app for push notifications with APNS. Add the following code to your
`application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:` method in your application delegate.

    - (BOOL) application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions
    {
        // Register for push notifications with the Apple Push Notification Service (APNS).
        //
        // On iOS 8.0+ you need to provide your user notification settings by calling
        // [UIApplication.sharedDelegate registerUserNotificationSettings:] and then
        // [UIApplication.sharedDelegate registerForRemoteNotifications];
        //
        // On < iOS 8.0 you need to provide your remote notification settings by calling
        // [UIApplication.sharedDelegate registerForRemoteNotificationTypes:].  There are no
        // user notification settings on < iOS 8.0.
        //
        // If this line gives you a compiler error then you need to make sure you have updated
        // your Xcode to at least Xcode 6.0:
        //
        if ([application respondsToSelector:@selector(registerUserNotificationSettings:)]) {

            // iOS 8.0 +
            UIUserNotificationType notificationTypes = UIUserNotificationTypeAlert | UIUserNotificationTypeBadge | UIUserNotificationTypeSound;
            UIUserNotificationSettings *settings = [UIUserNotificationSettings settingsForTypes:notificationTypes categories:nil];
            [application registerUserNotificationSettings:settings];
            [application registerForRemoteNotifications];

        } else {

            // < iOS 8.0
            UIRemoteNotificationType notificationTypes = UIRemoteNotificationTypeAlert | UIRemoteNotificationTypeBadge | UIRemoteNotificationTypeSound;
            [application registerForRemoteNotificationTypes:notificationTypes];
        }

        return YES;
    }

   * The call to '[self.locationManager requestAlwaysAuthorization]` is described below.  It is only required if using
   geofences.

   * The notification types for < iOS 8.0 are described in the [UIApplication Class Reference]
   https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/documentation/uikit/reference/UIApplication_Class/Reference/Reference.html#//apple_ref/doc/c_ref/UIRemoteNotificationType).

   * Note that the OS will display a dialog box on the screen at runtime to confirm the requested notification types
   to the user when the app attempts to register for push notifications the first time.

## Step 6 - Register for Push Notifications with Pivotal Cloud Foundry ##

Include the following header in your application delegate class:

    #import <PCFPush/PCFPush.h>

In your application delegate's `application:didRegisterforRemoteNotifications:` method put the following code:

    // This method is called when APNS registration succeeds.
    - (void) application:(UIApplication *)app didRegisterForRemoteNotificationsWithDeviceToken:(NSData *)deviceToken
    {
        NSLog(@"APNS registration succeeded!");

        // APNS registration has succeeded and provided the APNS device token.  Start registration with PCF Mobile Services
        // and pass it the APNS device token.
        //
        // Required: Create a file in your project called "Pivotal.plist" in order to provide parameters for registering with
        // PCF Mobile Services.
        //
        // Optional: You can also provide a set of tags to subscribe to.
        //
        // Optional: You can also provide a device alias.  The use of this device alias is application-specific.  In general,
        // you can pass the device name.
        //
        // Optional: You can pass blocks to get callbacks after registration succeeds or fails.
        //
        [PCFPush registerForPCFPushNotificationsWithDeviceToken:deviceToken tags:YOUR_TAGS deviceAlias:YOUR_DEVICE_ALIAS success:^{
            NSLog(@"CF registration succeeded!");
        } failure:^(NSError *error) {
            NSLog(@"CF registration failed: %@", error);
        }];
    }

   * The `YOUR_TAGS` parameter is a parameter that provides a set of the tags that you'd like the application to subscribe
   to. This parameter should be an `NSSet` object containing a set of `NSString` objects.  If you pass in tags via this
   register method then you need to provide ALL tags that the user has subscribed to each time registration is called.  To
   manage your tags you can also call the `[PCFPush subscribeToTags:success:failure:]` method (described below).

   * The `YOUR_DEVICE_ALIAS` parameter is a custom parameter that you can use to identify a user's device (eg: a user may
   have multiple devices) - this is for future use.  We suggest that you use the user's device name to populate this field
   (e.g.: `UIDevice.currentDevice.name`).

   * All of the `deviceAlias`, `tags`, `success`, and `failure` parameters are optional and may be set to `nil`.

   * You can call the `[PCFPush registerForPCFPushNotificationsWithDeviceToken:tags:deviceAlias:success:failure:]` method
   whenever your parameterization changes during runtime (e.g.: when you want to update the device alias).  It is not
   harmful to call this method several times during the lifetime of a process.

# Receiving Push Notifications #

To receive push notifications you can implement the following code in your application delegate class.

* **VERY IMPORTANT:** You must call the `[PCFPush didReceiveRemoteNotification:completionHandler:]` method in your
application delegate `application:didReceiveRemoteNotification:fetchCompletionHandler` method, as demonstrated below.

    // This method is called when APNS sends a push notification to the application.
    - (void) application:(UIApplication *)application didReceiveRemoteNotification:(NSDictionary *)userInfo
    {
        [self handleRemoteNotification:userInfo];
    }

    // This method is called when APNS sends a push notification to the application when the application is
    // not running (e.g.: in the background).  Requires the application to have the Remote Notification Background Mode Capability.
    - (void)application:(UIApplication *)application didReceiveRemoteNotification:(NSDictionary *)userInfo fetchCompletionHandler:(void (^)(UIBackgroundFetchResult))completionHandler
    {
        [self handleRemoteNotification:userInfo];

        // IMPORTANT: Inform PCF Push Notification Service that this message has been received.
        [PCFPush didReceiveRemoteNotification:userInfo completionHandler:^(BOOL wasIgnored, UIBackgroundFetchResult fetchResult, NSError *error) {

            if (completionHandler) {
                completionHandler(fetchResult);
            }
        }];
    }

    // This method is called when the user touches one of the actions in a notification when the application is
    // not running (e.g.: in the background).  iOS 8.0+ only.
    - (void)application:(UIApplication *)application handleActionWithIdentifier:(NSString *)identifier forRemoteNotification:(NSDictionary *)userInfo completionHandler:(void(^)())completionHandler
    {
        NSLog(@"Handling action %@ for message %@", identifier, userInfo);
        if (completionHandler) {
            completionHandler();
        }
    }

    - (void) handleRemoteNotification:(NSDictionary*) userInfo
    {
        if (userInfo) {
            NSLog(@"Received push message: %@", userInfo);
        } else {
            NSLog(@"Received push message (no userInfo).");
        }
    }

# Geofences #

Geofences are newly supported in version 1.3.0 of the Push Notification Service.  Using this service you will be able to
register push notifications that your app users will see when they enter or exit certain geographic regions that you
define on the Push Notification Service Dashboard.

In order to set up your app to receive geofence notifications please follow these steps.

## Step 1 - Set your background modes ##

Ensure your **location updates** and **remote notifications** background modes have been set for your project target
capabilities.

![Background modes](./1.3.0/assets/plist-background-modes.png)

## Step 2 - Set required device capabilities ##

Add **location-services** and **gps** to your application Info.plist file under "Required device capabilities".

![Info.plist Required device capabilities](./1.3.0/assets/plist-device-capabilities.png)

## Step 3 - Set your location usage description ##

If this is the first time that your app is using any location services then you will need to set the text that is
displayed on iOS 8.0+ when the app first requests the permission to read your current device location.  You can set this
text by setting the `NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription` key in your app's **Info.plist** file (contained in Supporting
Files folder by default).  e.g.: "Your App Name would like to read your current location and monitor geofences (if
enabled)."

![Location Usage Description](./1.3.0/assets/plist-location-usage-description.png)

## Step 4 - Link to Core Location ##

Ensure that your app is linked to the Core Location framework.  In Xcode, go to your app targets build phases screen and
add `CoreLocation.framework` to the **Link Binary With Libraries** build phase.

![Include Core Location](./1.3.0/assets/include-core-location.png)

## Step 5 - Enable geofences ##

Add the following boolean parameter to your Pivotal.plist file and set it to 'YES': `pivotal.push.geofencesEnabled`.
The `pivotal.push.geofencesEnabled` parameter is considered optional and must be set to 'YES' in order to enabled
geofences.  If this parameter is omitted or set to false then no geofences features will be available at runtime.

NOTE: At this time it is only possible to enable or disable geofences at compile-time using this above parameter.  It is
planned to add a run-time parameter to enable or disable geofences in a future release.

## Step 6 - Authorize location services ##

If using geofences on iOS 8.0+ devices you will need to add the method call to request permission from the user to read
the current device location.  A good place for that is in your application delegate
`application:didFinishLaunchingWithOptions` method.  This call will show an alert dialog box to the user that shows the
`NSLocationAlwaysUsageDescription` text in your plist file.

    - (BOOL) application:(UIApplication *)application didFinishLaunchingWithOptions:(NSDictionary *)launchOptions
    {
        // Register for push notifications with the Apple Push Notification Service (APNS).
        //
        // On iOS 8.0+ you need to provide your user notification settings by calling
        // [UIApplication.sharedDelegate registerUserNotificationSettings:] and then
        // [UIApplication.sharedDelegate registerForRemoteNotifications];
        //
        // On < iOS 8.0 you need to provide your remote notification settings by calling
        // [UIApplication.sharedDelegate registerForRemoteNotificationTypes:].  There are no
        // user notification settings on < iOS 8.0.
        //
        // If this line gives you a compiler error then you need to make sure you have updated
        // your Xcode to at least Xcode 6.0:
        //
        if ([application respondsToSelector:@selector(registerUserNotificationSettings:)]) {

            // iOS 8.0 +
            UIUserNotificationType notificationTypes = UIUserNotificationTypeAlert | UIUserNotificationTypeBadge | UIUserNotificationTypeSound;
            UIUserNotificationSettings *settings = [UIUserNotificationSettings settingsForTypes:notificationTypes categories:nil];
            [application registerUserNotificationSettings:settings];
            [application registerForRemoteNotifications];

            // NOTE: add this block to enable location services for geofences
            if ([application respondsToSelector:@selector(registerUserNotificationSettings:)]) {
               self.locationManager = [[CLLocationManager alloc] init];
               [self.locationManager requestAlwaysAuthorization]; // iOS 8.0+ only
            }

        } else {

            // < iOS 8.0
            UIRemoteNotificationType notificationTypes = UIRemoteNotificationTypeAlert | UIRemoteNotificationTypeBadge | UIRemoteNotificationTypeSound;
            [application registerForRemoteNotificationTypes:notificationTypes];
        }

        return YES;
    }

## Step 7 - Add property to application delegate ##

Required only if you are using geofences:  add a property to your application delegate class (AppDelegate.h) as follows:

    @property (strong, nonatomic) CLLocationManager *locationManager;

You will also need to include the following header to the same file:

    #import <CoreLocation/CoreLocation.h>

## Step 8 - Receiving Local Notifications (OPTIONAL) ##

If you follow the above steps then your application will be able to show geofences when they are triggered.  Geofences
are delivered as local notifications to your app.  Similar to remote notifications, local notifications will be
automatically displayed when your application is in the background but you will need to add your own code in order to
display them when your app is in the foreground.

If you need to know if the geofence was triggered via an 'enter' or 'exit' condition then look at the
'pivotal.push.geofence_trigger_condition' key in the userInfo dictionary provided with the location notification.  You
can also use this userInfo field to distinguish geofence local notifications from other kinds of local notifications.

As an example, if you want to print a log message when a local notification is received:

    - (void) application:(UIApplication *)application didReceiveLocalNotification:(UILocalNotification *)notification
    {
        NSLog(@"Received %@ local notification '%@'", notification.userInfo[@"pivotal.push.geofence_trigger_condition"], notification.alertBody);
    }

## Step 9 - Receive Geofence Status Updates (OPTIONAL) ##

The PCF Push Notification Service server will push updated geofences to user devices via push notifications.  You don't
need to do any more work to process these updates or monitor these geofences.  You can read the geofence status object
to find out if any problems occur during these background updates.  These errors can be reported directly to your
application if you create a `BroadcastReceiver` that listens to `io.pivotal.android.push.geofence.UPDATE` intents.

Example:

You can subscribe to the geofence update notification with the following code in your program.  You could put it in your
one of your view controllers or your application delegate, as you see fit.

    [[NSNotificationCenter defaultCenter] addObserver:self selector:@selector(geofenceStatusChanged:) name:PCF_PUSH_GEOFENCE_STATUS_UPDATE_NOTIFICATION object:nil];

The above method call will cause the `geofenceStatusChanged` method to be called.  You will need to define this method
yourself:

    - (void) geofenceStatusChanged:(NSNotification*)notification
    {
        PCFPushGeofenceStatus *status = [PCFPush geofenceStatus];
        NSLog(@"%@", status);
    }

# Subscribing to Tags #

The `[PCFPush subscribeToTags:success:failure:]` method allows you to manage your tags after registration has
completed.  If you call this method before registration is complete then an error will occur.  This parameter should be
an `NSSet` object containing a set  of `NSString` objects.

* In general, an application should keep track of all of the tags it is currently subscribed to.  Whenever you call
`[PCFPush registerForPCFPushNotificationsWithDeviceToken:tags:deviceAlias:success:failure:]` or `[PCFPush
subscribeToTags:success:failure:] you need to pass **ALL** of the tags that the application is currently subscribed to.
If you want to add new tags you must provide them alongside the tags you are currently subscribed to.  If you omit
some tags then the SDK will think that you want to **unsubscribe** from those tags.

# Unregistering from Pivotal Cloud Foundry Push Notification Service #

The `[PCFPush unregisterFromPCFPushNotificationsWithSuccess:failure:]` method allows you to unregister from push
notifications from PCF.
