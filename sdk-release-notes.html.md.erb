title: Push Notification Service Android and iOS Client SDKs v1.4.0 Release Notes
---

The Push Notification services allows application developers to publish push notifications to devices on various platforms. Integration is done through provided SDKs which implement the device registration flow.

## SDK Documentation and Setup Guides

 - [iOS](../ios/ios.html)
 - [Android](../android/android.html)

## Dependencies

 - iOS 7.0+ with Xcode 6.2+
 - Android 4.1+ with Android Studio 1.2+
 - PCF Push Notification Service 1.3.2+ (if you are collecting analytics data)
 - PCF Push Notification Service 1.3.0+ (if you are using geofences)
 - PCF Push Notification Service 1.2.0+ (if you are not using geofences)

## Known issues

### iOS

 - The iOS SDK only supports 20 geofences monitored at one time.
 - The iOS SDK is not compatible with any other library or app trying to monitor geofences in the same app at the same time. If there are other geofences being monitored by an app then the Push Client SDK will delete them.
 - The iOS SDK will not always trigger a geofence if the device is currently inside of it at the same time that the geofence is registered (or when the geofence's tag is subscribed to).
 - iOS 7.0 does not support being used as a framework.  If you target iOS 7 then you must build from source (e.g.: via Cocoapods).
 - If a remote notification does not have the `"content-available":1` field in its payload and if the user does not touch the notification then there will be no analytics event logged for receiving the notification when the application is in the background (since iOS does not call the application for the remote notifications in the background without `"content-available":1`).

### Android

 - The Android SDK only supports 100 geofences monitored at one time.
 - The Android SDK is not compatible with any other library or app trying to monitor geofences in the same app at the same time. If there are other geofences being monitored by an app then the Push Client SDK will delete them.
 - Geofences are not monitored after the user turns Location Services off and on again.
 - The Android SDK does not support the new Google Play Services APIs for registering for push notifications (i.e.: using the `InstanceID` service and the `google-service.json` file).

## List of Changes

 - The iOS SDK now supports iOS 9.0+.
 - The Android SDK now supports Android 6.0+ (including the new permission system).
 - The Android SDK no longer supports Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich).  The minimum support API level is now 16 (Jellybean).

## Android Upgrade Notes

 - In order to support geofences on Android 6.0 Marshmallow you will need to directly ask for permission to read the device location at runtime.  Please see the [Android SDK](../android/android.html) documentation for instructions.
 - Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich) is no longer supported.  If you really need to support Android 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich) then you will have to add your own code to request the GET\_ACCOUNT permission at runtime.  Please note that this configuration is not supported by Pivotal CF.

## iOS Upgrade Notes

 - There are no breaking changes in the iOS SDK.
